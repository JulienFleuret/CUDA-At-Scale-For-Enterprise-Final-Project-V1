On Linux Ubuntu:
1) Install Nvidia CUDA, git, bash, make, cmake, dpkg.
Optional dependencies: 
			-oneAPI, or libtbb2.

2) use the run.sh file to create the "bin" directory.

If you wish to install the content of the bin directory in the /usr/local folder, and you are sudoer, you can go in the "build" folder and call the command "sudo make install".
